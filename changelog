hs_transfer:
  - refactor: each tranfer type one class, this way is more extensible
  - allow multiple tranfser profiles given at the same time
  - don't create temporary files on disk unless necessary. Eg use StringIO and
    implement create_file replacing transfer_file
    TODO: check that none of the Transfer::* implementations close the file
    handle when they are done, because hs_transfer is using rewind
- delete .ts files in the tmp directory after transferring
- delete current-N'th segment from server to avoid filling it up
  delete_nth_segment_back setting like index_segment_count
- url_prefix,
  url_prefix_m3u  (defaulting to url_prefix)
  is now configured in the copy profile configuration
  Each copy location has its own index file with custom url_prefix now
- first copy segment, then index!
- add 
  cf_aws_api_key
  cf_aws_api_secret
  cf_distribution_id
  .m3u8 files

- info: While there is the S3 bucket target it might be better to copy the
files to a HTTP server and use amazon cloudfront to read from it.
At least I was not able to configure the TTL for .m3u8 files so that they get
updated ..
